## About

I am a PhD student in Institute of Computational and Mathematical Engineering at
Stanford University. I work with Prof. Susan Holmes on developing methods for
analyzing high-dimensional data from genomics and microbiome studies. I focus on
developing methods for time series analysis and dimensionality reduction methods
for data exhibiting continuous latent gradients that provide uncertainty
estimates. I also study properties (stability, robustness etc.) of other
non-linear DR methods.
