I am a PhD student in Institute of Computational and Mathematical Engineering at
Stanford University working with  [Prof. Susan
Holmes](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html). My research
focuses on statistical methods for analyzing high-dimensional heterogeneous data
mostly with applications for genomics and microbiome.

My interests include:

- non-linear dimensionality reduction methods
- latent variable models
- uncertainty quantification
- time series analysis
- data analysis and visualization
- machine learning

Previously, I did my undergraduate work in applied mathematics and economics
at California Institute of Technology, where my advisor was
[Prof. Houman Owhadi](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm).

## Organizations

I am a co-founder and a core member of [WiMSCE: Women in Mathematics,
Statistics, and Computational Engineering](https://wimsce.stanford.edu/).

In 2016-2017, I was a co-president and a financial officer for
[Stanford Polish Student Association](https://orgsync.com/79672/chapter).
